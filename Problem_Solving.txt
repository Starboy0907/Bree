This is problem solving with Data Structures and Algorithms

I. There should be a systematic approach to problem solving
    A. Prepare Yourself- pen, paper, and whatever else you need to be at thr ready
    B. Bring up another environment i.e. run.js
    C. Read the Question for understanding
    D. Read the Question for clarity
    E. Write down steps you need to take
    F. Write down any key variables and what there uses are.
    G. Note any flowcharts that need to be worked through.
    H. Take note of any branching conditions or special conditions that need to be accounted for
    I. Take not of what your output should be
    J. Take note of the data type your output should be in
    K. Step though the logic of the sample input and output and see how they are getting from point a to point b.
    L. Create a Plan
    M. Start coding
        a. Put the comments in first
        b. Note the data structures and pieces of algorithms you want to use.
        c. Dont spend time optimizing a solution before you have a working solution.
    N. Refactoring and Optimization
    O. If you get stuck:
        a. Don't Worry, Be Happy
        b. Isolate the problem by pinpointing
        c. Review how the input and output are being calculated
        d. Break down the steps to its simplest terms
        e. Research piece by piece
